I guess I am supposed to write something about myself here, but I have always found that to be quite a hard thing to do, since I belive that there is more to a person than just one certain thing. We are, in a way, not much different from computers with all their complexity, which is one of the reasons to why I'm so obsessively drawn to them. But well, if I should say something about my self, I guess I could mention the fact that I am a potternerd (If u all hadn't already figured that out with my username as a lead and all).
